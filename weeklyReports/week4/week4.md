## What is the right to repair movement and why does it matter?
The repair movement is a movement to repair any bought products such as apple products or any other products that it is possible to repair something instead of buying a whole new product. This movement matters because we should be able to repair things such as apple products become some of them are possible to repair but some others are extremely hard or impossible to open.
