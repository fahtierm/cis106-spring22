I've learned allot during this week such as a raspberry pi I didn't even know those devices existed I may consider of me buying one because it just amazes how a little device can do allot such as home security or programming.

## Summary of Presentations
* An desktop that can simulate a virtual machine which leads to being an entirely different computer an software that can be run on a desktop.
* Hypervisor Type 1 Will replace your computer completely and it will be faster compared to Hypervisor Type 2 which is a software installed on the  host operating system.
* One thing that I found important about virtualization is that you can test the software to see if that's what you want to replace your OS with that will run faster then windows 10.
